You are an expert VHDL analyst. Your primary task is to meticulously analyze the provided VHDL code and generate comprehensive, human-readable descriptions at three distinct levels of detail.

The VHDL code will be supplied to you as input.

Please structure your entire response as a single JSON object containing the following three keys:
1.  `block_summary`
2.  `detailed_global_summary`
3.  `high_level_global_summary`

**General Guidelines for your descriptions:**
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure all descriptions are technically accurate and align with VHDL standards and best practices.
*   **Clarity:** Write in clear, coherent, and professional English. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice, or explain necessary technical terms.
*   **Focus:** Your descriptions must be based solely on the provided VHDL code. Do not invent functionality or make assumptions beyond what the code specifies.
*   **No Code Generation:** Your task is to *explain* existing VHDL code, not to generate new VHDL code.

"detailed_global_summary": "\n <s>[INST] <<SYS>>\n You only complete chats with syntax correct Verilog code. End the Verilog module code completion with 'endmodule'. Do not include module, input and output definitions.\n <</SYS>>\n\n Implement the Verilog module based on the following description. Assume that signals are positive clock/clk edge triggered unless otherwise stated.\n\n\nThis Verilog module implements a shift register FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue. It has four ports: X, Y, clk, and an integer parameter depth. The X port is an input port of width width, which is the number of bits in the shift register. The Y port is an output port of width width, which outputs the contents of the shift register. The clk port is a clock input that triggers the shifting of the register. The depth parameter is an integer that specifies the number of stages in the shift register.\n\nThe module uses a single always block that is triggered by a rising edge of the clock signal. Inside the always block, there is a for loop that iterates over the depth of the shift register. In each iteration, the contents of the shift register are shifted one stage to the right by assigning the value of mem[index-1] to mem[index]. This has the effect of shifting the contents of the register one bit to the right in each stage.\n\nAt the end of the for loop, the value of mem[depth-1] is assigned to Y, which outputs the contents of the final stage of the shift register. This means that the output Y is the same as the input X shifted by depth clock cycles.\n\nFinally, the initial value of the shift register is set by assigning X to mem[0].\n\nIn summary, this Verilog module implements a shift register FIFO queue that takes an input X and outputs Y, where Y is X shifted by depth clock cycles. The shift register has depth stages, each of which can hold a value of width bits. The module uses a single always block and a for loop to implement the shifting of the register.\n\n Module header:\n\nmodule shiftRegFIFO(X, Y, clk);\n [/INST]\n",

Assume that signals are positive clock/clk edge triggered unless otherwise stated.\n\nThis Verilog module implements a shift register FIFO (First-In-First-Out) with a specified depth and width. It has an input X, an output Y, and a clock input. The module uses a memory array to store the input data and shifts the data on each clock cycle. The output Y is assigned the data at the end of the shift register. The input X is loaded into the first position of the memory array.\n\n Module header:\n\nmodule shiftRegFIFO(X, Y, clk);\n [/INST]\n"
