It has a clock-based process that updates the current state and output signals. The FSM has eight states, each with its own set of conditions to transition to another state based on the input signal. The output signals are generated based on the current state. The design uses STD_MATCH functions to compare the input signal with specific patterns.\n [/INST]\n",

It has eight states, each handling distinct input patterns.\n [/INST]\n"
