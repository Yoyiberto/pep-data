  "block_summary": "The provided VHDL code defines an entity `ex6_rnd` and its behavioral architecture. The design implements a state machine controlled by a clock signal and an input signal. The architecture uses a state variable, `current_state`, and a combinatorial next state logic dependent on the `input` and `current_state`. The output `output` is a function of the current state and the input signal. The design utilizes `std_match` for pattern matching on the input signal.",
  "detailed_global_summary": "This VHDL code describes a synchronous state machine named `ex6_rnd`. The entity has a clock input (`clock`), an input port (`input`) of 5 bits, and an output port (`output`) of 8 bits. The architecture `behaviour` defines the state machine's logic.  It uses constants `s1` through `s8` to represent the states. Two signals, `current_state` and `next_state` (both 3 bits wide), are used to store the current state and calculate the next state, respectively. A clocked process updates `current_state` on the rising edge of the `clock`. A second combinatorial process determines `next_state` and `output` based on the current_state and input. The combinatorial process uses a `case` statement to define the state transitions and output values for each state and input combination, with `std_match` used to match patterns on the input signal. The `others` clause handles undefined states by setting the output to an invalid value.",
  "high_level_global_summary": "The VHDL code describes a state machine implementation named `ex6_rnd`. The entity has a clock, an input, and an output. The architecture `behaviour` contains two processes: a clocked process which updates the `current_state` on the rising edge of the clock, and a combinatorial process which determines the `next_state` and the `output` based on the `current_state` and the `input`. The `input` signal is matched against various patterns to determine the next state and output values using a `case` statement. The design uses `std_match` for pattern matching, and the output signal is a function of the current state and the input pattern. The state machine transitions between eight states represented by constants s1-s8. An `others` clause defines the default behavior."
