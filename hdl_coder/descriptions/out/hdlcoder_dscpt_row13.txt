The state machine transitions based on the input signal 'input' (5 bits) and produces an 8-bit output signal 'output'.  The code uses 'std_match' to compare the input to specific patterns, implementing a pattern recognition or state transition logic.\n [/INST]\n",

Include all required entities, ports, signals, and logic to ensure compilable code.\n <</SYS>>\n\nThe design defines an entity 'ex6_rnd' with a clock input, a 5-bit input 'input', and an 8-bit output 'output'. The architecture 'behaviour' implements a state machine using two processes. The first process is a clocked process that updates the 'current_state' signal on the rising edge of the clock. The second process is a combinational process that determines the 'next_state' and the 'output' based on the current state and the 'input' signal. The design uses constants (s1-s8) to represent the states. The 'case' statement within the second process defines the state transition logic and output generation for each state. The 'std_match' function is used to perform pattern matching on the input signal, allowing for wildcard characters ('-'). The default state transition and output are handled by the 'others' clause.\n [/INST]\n",

Include all required entities, ports, signals, and logic to ensure compilable code.\n <</SYS>>\n\nThis VHDL module implements a pattern-matching state machine. It takes a 5-bit input and generates an 8-bit output based on the current state and the input pattern. The state transitions are defined by a set of rules using the 'std_match' function for flexible pattern recognition. The design likely serves as a data processing or control module, capable of reacting to different input patterns and producing corresponding outputs.\n [/INST]\n"
