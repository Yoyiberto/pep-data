Include all required entities, ports, signals, and logic to ensure compilable code.\n <</SYS>>\n\nThe VHDL code defines an entity named `opus_nov` with a 5-bit input and a 6-bit output, both using `std_logic_vector`. The architecture `behaviour` implements a state machine driven by the clock signal. The state machine uses a 4-bit `current_state` signal and determines the `next_state` and `output` based on the input signal and the current state. Several constants define state and control values.\n [/INST]\n",

Include all required entities, ports, signals, and logic to ensure compilable code.\n <</SYS>>\n\nThe `opus_nov` entity represents a state machine that processes a 5-bit input and generates a 6-bit output. The architecture `behaviour` defines a state machine with a synchronous process updating the `current_state` on the rising edge of the clock. A second process determines the `next_state` and the output based on the current state and the input. Various constants like `init0`, `init1`, `init2`, `init4`, `IOwait`, `RMACK`, `WMACK`, `read0`, `read1`, and `write0` define the states and control values. The state transitions and output generation are implemented using a `case` statement within the second process, responding to the input and current state. The `std_match` function is employed for pattern matching on the input.\n [/INST]\n",

Include all required entities, ports, signals, and logic to ensure compilable code.\n <</SYS>>\n\nThis VHDL code describes a digital circuit implemented as a state machine. The circuit receives a 5-bit input and produces a 6-bit output. The state machine's behavior is determined by the input values and the current state, which dictates state transitions and the circuit's output. The circuit utilizes a clock signal for synchronous operation and incorporates several states and control signals to process the input and generate the appropriate output.\n [/INST]\n"
