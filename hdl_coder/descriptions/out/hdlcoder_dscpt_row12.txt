  "block_summary": "This VHDL code describes a state machine named `opus_nov`. It has an input `input` (5 bits) and an output `output` (6 bits), along with a clock input `clock`. The state machine's behavior is defined within the `behaviour` architecture. The code uses constants to represent different states and control signals.  Two processes are defined: one to synchronize the `current_state` with the `clock`, and another to determine the `next_state` and `output` values based on the `input` and the `current_state`.",
  "detailed_global_summary": "The VHDL code implements a state machine for the entity `opus_nov`. The entity has an input `input` and an output `output`, along with a clock input. The architecture `behaviour` defines the state machine's behavior. Constants are declared to represent various states and control signals (e.g., `init0`, `IOwait`, `RMACK`).\n\nThe code uses two processes. The first process, sensitive to the `clock`, updates the `current_state` with the `next_state` on the rising edge of the clock.  The second process, sensitive to the `input` and `current_state`, determines the `next_state` and the `output` value. This process uses a `case` statement based on the `current_state`. Inside each `when` clause of the `case` statement, `if` statements and `std_match` functions are used to evaluate the `input` signal and determine the `next_state` and `output`. The `std_match` function allows for wildcard matching in the input signal.  If the input matches a particular pattern, the state machine transitions to a new state and the output is changed accordingly.  The `others` clause in the `case` statement handles any undefined states.\n",
  "high_level_global_summary": "This VHDL code describes a state machine. The entity `opus_nov` has input `input`, output `output`, and a clock `clock`. The `behaviour` architecture defines the state machine's operation. The code defines several state constants (e.g., `init0`, `IOwait`).\n\nThe design uses two processes. One process is clocked and updates `current_state` with `next_state`. The other process is combinational, driven by `input` and `current_state`. This second process uses a `case` statement, where each case represents a state.  Inside each state's `when` clause, `if` statements and `std_match` are used to evaluate the input and determine the next state and output. The `std_match` performs pattern matching on the input.  The output is assigned based on the current state and the input, and the next state is determined based on the input pattern. The `others` clause handles undefined states."
