It uses a matrix representation for the chessboard and manages the placement of queens. It incorporates blocking signals (BH, BV, BU, BD) to represent constraints, and employs an 'arbit_forward' component to determine queen placement. The core logic involves a state machine and control signals (start, put, done, sol) to manage the search space and solution detection.\n [/INST]\n",

Include all required entities, ports, signals, and logic to ensure compilable code.\n <</SYS>>\n\nThe VHDL code describes a module, 'queens_slice', designed as a component of an N-Queens solver. It's parameterized by 'N' (board size) and 'L' (number of preplaced outer rings). The architecture 'rtl' implements the solver logic. It includes a 'tField' type representing the chessboard and signals for queen placement ('QN'), blocking information ('BH', 'BV', 'BU', 'BD'), and control ('start', 'put', 'done', 'sol'). The code utilizes an 'arbit_forward' component to handle the placement of queens within a column. Processes handle clock synchronization for queen matrix updates, blocking signal calculations, and control signal management. The 'blkPlace' block encapsulates the core logic, including the column front selector (CS), direction control (Fwd, H), and the calculation of 'put' (queen placement) and output signals 'sol' and 'done'. The code uses assertions for documentation and license information.\n [/INST]\n",

Include all required entities, ports, signals, and logic to ensure compilable code.\n <</SYS>>\n\nThis VHDL code implements a portion of an N-Queens solver. It is designed to handle a specific slice of the chessboard, managing queen placement and checking for conflicts. It uses an iterative approach employing blocking signals to represent constraints and an arbitration mechanism to determine valid queen positions. The module's primary function is to determine the placement of queens in its assigned slice of the board, indicating a solution (sol) or completion (done) through output signals.\n [/INST]\n"
