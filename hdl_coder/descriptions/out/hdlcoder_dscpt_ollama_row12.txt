The current state is updated on each rising clock edge, and the next state is determined by the current state and the input pattern.\n [/INST]\n",

Include all required entities, ports, signals, and logic to ensure compilable code.\n <</SYS>>\n\nThe VHDL design 'opus_nov' has an entity with ports for clock and input/output signals (5-bit input and 6-bit output). It features a behavioral architecture containing various states: initialization (init0, init1), read (read0, read1), write (write0), and wait (IOwait) modes. Each state has specific conditions for transitioning to the next state based on input patterns. Signals like 'current_state' and 'next_state' are crucial for its operation.\n [/INST]\n",

Include all required entities, ports, signals, and logic to ensure compilable code.\n <</SYS>>\n\nThis VHDL module implements a finite state machine that responds to external inputs, transitioning between different states according to specific rules. The design manages various modes (initiation, read, write, wait), controlling the output behavior based on the current state and input patterns.\n [/INST]\n"
